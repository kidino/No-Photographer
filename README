No-Photographer
===============

No photographer for your event -- no problem!

Get your attendees to share their photos and award them with badges and titles
like:

- User with most uploads (The Fashion Photographer)
- User with most tags (The Top Model)
- User that tagged others the most (The Mag Editor)
- and more...

No-Photographer aims to get everyone attending an event in the photo album,
including the photographer, by adding gamification to the solve the problem. It
is also meant to be a photo-sharing hub among attendees of the event. The
motivation for this project came when I was a committee of a small reunion and
we didn't have a budget for a photographer. But nobody in the committee wants
to be the designated photographer because nobody wants to be left behind. With
No-Photographer, we make use everyone's camera in the event and award them with
badges like "Member that uploaded the most photos", "Most tagged member" and
probably some others that we could think of later.
